# Machine-Learning-for-Titanic
My pre-graduate Thesis on the subject of Machine Learning for Survival of Titanic passengers.


Short Description:

· The Thesis is mainly focused on implementing and evaluating different ML algorithms (Neural Network, Decision Trees, Perceptron, Naïve Bayes, …) 
  using a Dataset of characteristics for the Titanic passengers. Much attention was needed for the Dataset itself. Cleaning, processing and 
  visualizing the data was a vital step in helping the Predictive Models train themselves. The output of predictions was measured in Accuracy and 
  evaluated by ROC & PR curves. The chances of survival are decided ultimately by their own characteristics.

· The Thesis also contains the theoretical background, like the Types of ML, different Prediction Models and methods of Evaluation.
